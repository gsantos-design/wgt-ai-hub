âœ… Spanish support working
âœ… Speech-to-text working
âœ… Enhanced UI working

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Update Render Deployment (RECOMMENDED - Fastest)

Since hub.boldhorizonsfinancial.com is already pointing to Render, we just need to update the code there.

**Steps:**

1. **Check your Render dashboard**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find your service (likely called "wgt-ai-hub" or similar)

2. **Update the code** - Choose ONE method:

   **Method A: Via Git (if connected to GitHub)**
   - Push these files to your GitHub repo
   - Render will auto-deploy

   **Method B: Via Render Manual Deploy**
   - Upload the updated files via Render dashboard
   - Files to upload:
     - `server.js` (updated with dotenv)
     - `package.json` (updated with dotenv dependency)
     - `public/index.html` (new version)
     - `public/script.js` (new version)

   **Method C: Re-deploy from this folder**
   - Delete the old service on Render
   - Create new service pointing to: `C:\Users\gisel\Downloads\wgt-ai-hub-starter`
   - Set GEMINI_API_KEY in Render environment variables
   - Deploy

3. **Verify Environment Variable**
   - In Render dashboard, go to Environment
   - Confirm `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set to: `AIzaSyCbIB4LFLFpzAB9oMCOuR90d7kROFXaS2M`

4. **Test**
   - Visit hub.boldhorizonsfinancial.com
   - Verify Spanish toggle works
   - Verify microphone works
   - Verify AI responds

**Time: 10-15 minutes**

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

**"Not connected" status**
- Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set in Render environment
- Check API key is valid
- Check Render logs for errors

**Microphone not working**
- Must be HTTPS (Render provides this automatically)
- Browser must support Web Speech API
- User must grant permission

**Spanish not working**
- Check that new `script.js` was uploaded
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
